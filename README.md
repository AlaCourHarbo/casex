# CasEx
Implementation of the mathematics behind JARUS WG-6 SORA Annex F.

## Overview
This package was created to support the mathematical models used to derive
the iGRC tables and supporting material found in JARUS WG-6 SORA Annex F (Link here).
It implements the models for computing critical areas, effect of obstacles,
ballistic descent, effect of explosions and deflagration that are being used
in Annex F. It also includes easy access to the specific choice of parameters
that are used in Annex F. Finally, this package can be used for easily recreating some of the figures found
in Annex F.

The mathematical models implemented in the package are the results of the
combined effort of the Quantitative Methods subgroup under Working Group 6.

## Installation
To install CasEx, simply run the following command in your terminal.
